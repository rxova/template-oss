/**
 * Reads the oldest Node the published packages promise to run on, from the
 * `engines.node` in their manifests, for the CI job that installs each packed
 * tarball on exactly that Node.
 *
 * The unit matrix runs the newest release of each major, which proves little
 * about the floor: `>=22.13` is a promise about 22.13, and later 22.x minors add
 * APIs it does not have. Reading the floor from the manifests keeps the job and
 * the promise from drifting apart — lowering `engines` moves the job with it.
 *
 * One floor for the workspace. Packages that disagree fail here, by name,
 * rather than being tested on whichever floor happened to be read last.
